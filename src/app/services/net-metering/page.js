          NET METERING IN PAKISTAN

            Everyone wants to get maximum benefits out of their solar panels and pay very little or no electricity bill, right? But the question is how is this possible?
          </p>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            Well, one of the easiest way to achieve this is by adding net metering to your existing solar system. 
          </p>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            So, you wonder how does the system work and provide benefit to its customers?
          </p>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            The process is quite straightforward. In most of the cases, solar panels produce more electricity than you required usage? So where does the extra produced electricity go? now if you have the net metering in place, the extra generated energy is automatically sent back to the grid.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-6 font-semibold text-green-600'>
            What does user get in return?
          </p>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            And when your solar panels aren't producing energy at night or during the rain or winter days, you can use those credits to cover your electricity needs. Please note that the electricity you sell back to the grid and the electricity you use at night or whenever your energy needs exceed the limit of your solar production both have different rates, which depend on the region's own electricity rules and regulations. Considering how high electricity prices are in Pakistan, adding net metering is a super convenient solution to tackle those hefty billing issues.

            HOW NET METERING WORKS IN PAKISTAN

              <p>
                The net metering in Pakistan is available for only grid tied system: on
                grid or hybrid, because the requirement to install net meter is you must
                be connected to the main grid in order to get the benefit of net
                metering.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">HERE'S HOW IT WORKS</h3>
              <p>
                The power company installs a special meter called a net meter or green
                meter at your place, and this meter can measure both the electricity you
                use and the extra electricity your panels send back to the grid.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although, the electricity provider company in most cases only installs a
                single meter, they can also install two separate meters. But usually,
                it's just one that checks both the import and export of electricity.

                In most cases, the power company will use this method to compensate the user. This process works just like your monthly electricity bill; at the end of each billing cycle, your electricity meter readings are compared. And you are only charged for the net difference between the electricity you consumed from the grid and the surplus you fed back.

              Net metering is an incredible device that lets you share surplus energy with the power grid. Here's how it works: when you produce more electricity than you require during the day, the excess power is sent back to the grid. Then, during nighttime when your solar panels aren't generating electricity, you can draw energy from the grid using the credits earned from your exported energy, effectively reducing your costs. With a properly installed system, you can generate sufficient solar energy to meet all of your electricity needs throughout the year, eliminating the need to pay electricity bills. It's a fantastic way to both save money and contribute to a greener future.
