                <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold m-4 p-4 text-left'>10kW Solar System Price in Pakistan</h1>
                <p className='text-left'>A 10kW solar system is one of the most popular solar solutions in Pakistan, especially for medium to large households, small businesses, and shops. It can easily cover electricity bills of up to 1,200–1,500 units per month.  

                As of today (October 1, 2024), the average price of a 10kW solar system in Pakistan, including Tier 1 solar panels, a 10kW inverter, mounting structure, and complete installation, is around Rs. 1,350,000.  

                With net metering, this system not only eliminates your electricity bills but also allows you to sell excess electricity back to the grid, making it a smart and long-term investment for 25+ years.</p>

                <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold m-4 p-4'>What is a 10kW Solar System?</h1>
                <p className='text-left'>A 10kW solar system produces about 40–45 kWh (units) of electricity per day, depending on sunlight conditions. This is sufficient to run most household and commercial appliances.  

                A typical 10kW setup consists of 16–18 solar panels (550–600 watts each), a 10kW solar inverter, mounting structure, DC cables, and other essential installation equipment.</p>
                <img src="image/logo" alt="image" />
                <p className='text-left'>This capacity is ideal for families or businesses with high energy usage, including multiple air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, LED TVs, computers, and water motors. It provides reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable energy throughout the year.</p>
