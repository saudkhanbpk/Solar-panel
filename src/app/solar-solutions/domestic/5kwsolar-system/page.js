                <p>The demand for 5kW solar systems in Pakistan is increasing day by day, and the primary reasons behind this surge are the higher electricity rates, power outages, and frequent load shedding. The benefits you can get by installing a 5kW solar solution for your home are numerous, from saving thousands of rupees every month on your electricity bills to having a reliable and independent source of electricity. The profits even double if you incorporate net metering with your solar PV system,  leading to even a zero electricity bill.

                  The system has the capacity to produce almost 570 units monthly. Taking a deeper look into the consumption of mid-sized homes in Pakistan, it lies between 500 and 600 units. If you are someone with a consumption of approximately 500 to 600 units of electricity per month, a 5kW solar system is the ideal choice for your home.

                  One can expect to install 5kw solar system at a reasonable price of Rs. 780,000 (With 10kw Inverter, brand will be Goodwe/Solis with 05 years warranty). The price include the 5kw on grid inverter, roof mounted L2 structure, and installation charges.  While the initial cost may seem high to many, the benefits provided by a 5kw solar system are enormous.

                <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold m-4 p-4'>What Is 5kw Solar System?</h1>
                <p>A 5kw solar system is capable of producing more than 20kWh of electricity or 19 units per day. It consists of 9 solar panels, each with a capacity of 590 watts, a solar inverter, and other essential components. On average, a 5kw system generates over 570 units of electricity every month, which is sufficient for middle-class families to power most of their home appliances, including 2 Inverter ACs (1.5 ton each)  LEDs, fans, 2 LED TVs and a refrigerator

                  However, running all these appliances simultaneously may not be feasible.</p>

                <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold p--4 m-4'>5kw Solar System Price In Pakistan</h1>
                <p>The 5kW solar system price in Pakistan starts from Rs. 780,000/- for an on-grid system with net metering(Inverter brand will be Goodwe/Solis with 05 years warranty). This cost includes the 10kW on-grid inverter, L2 mounting structures, and installation charges. Installing a 5kW solar system can significantly reduce your electricity bill. However, if you opt for a hybrid 5kW solar system, the price with 4 tubular batteries and 6kW Primax Invertor will be to Rs. 810,000/-. Hybrid solar inverters are generally more expensive than on-grid solar inverters, and the addition of batteries raise the overall cost of the system.</p>

                <p>The 5kw on-grid solar system is the most commonly used solar panel system in Pakistani homes due to its affordability, as it requires a lower-priced solar inverter and eliminates the need for batteries. The 5kva solar system price in Pakistan starts from Rs. 780,000 depending on factors such as the brand of solar panels, the quality of the inverter, the type of structure, and the quality and brands of other essential components. which can result in significant monthly savings.</p>

                <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold m-4 p-4'>Hybrid 5kw Solar System Price In Pakistan</h1>
                <p>In general terms, a solar system with batteries as a backup option is known as a hybrid solar system. Hybrid inverters are more expensive as they have the capability to switch between solar power, battery power, and grid power. Additionally, the hybrid system includes batteries, which are also higher in price. On average, a 12V 185-amp battery can be purchased for around 60,000 rupees, but dry batteries are significantly more expensive and can cost in the lakhs. Therefore, it is challenging to provide an exact hybrid 5kVA solar system price in Pakistan because the number of batteries and the quality of the solar inverter both affect the overall cost of the system.  Generally, two tubular batteries are installed with a 5kVA hybrid system at an estimated price of 810,000 pkr.</p>
